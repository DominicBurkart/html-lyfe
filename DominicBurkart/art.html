artist's statement
<p>
I work mostly in photography (film and digital), durational / action-oriented performance art, music, and digital mixed media. As an intermedia artist, I am most interested in the intersections and relationships between artworks and the construction of complex, interconnected narratives.
<br><br>
My art practice focuses on aesthetics of deconstruction and selective reconstruction. Over time, emotionality, referentiality, and relationality have become more integral in my practice. My generative work has consistently emphasized queerness and criticisms of hierarchy, malignant dialectics, and other reductive frameworks; however, I also find great meaning in documentation (especially in portraiture and performance archiving), primarily through photography. I create art to better understand my existence.
