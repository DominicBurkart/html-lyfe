I work mostly in photography (film and digital), durational / action-oriented performance art, music, and digital mixed media. As an intermedia artist, I am most interested in the intersections and relationships between artworks and the construction of complex, interconnected narratives.
<br><br>
My art practice focuses on aesthetics of deconstruction and selective reconstruction. In my art, I interrogate relationships between concepts, most often subsets of gender, economics, image, and simulation, and create dialogue with others about these relationships. My work has consistently emphasized queerness and criticisms of hierarchy, malignant dialectics, and other reductive frameworks.
<br><br>
Recently, I've been focused on the physical properties of image through refraction, distortion, and obscuration in relation to considerations of rationality, objectivity, and gaze.
